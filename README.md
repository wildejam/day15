# GIVE IT UP FOR DAY 15!
Inspired by the twitter account @giveitupfor15, this is a Discord bot written in Python that pings everyone in the server at midnight on the 15th day of every month
(MST/MDT). In addition, the bot features a number of fun commands related to DAY 15 for a bit of spice!

# Using this repository
This repository was created to act as a record for me to keep track of the releases for the DAY 15 bot, and to act as a public record of my work on this bot. The code
here should be identical to that which runs the actual bot, but of course with the Discord private bot token omitted from the environment variable file. This entire
project is merely a personal one for myself, so if you'd like to borrow/use anything here, please feel free to!

# More about the DAY 15 Bot
This bot was programmed in Python using the [discord.py module](https://discordpy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), in addition to several other standard Python modules.
## User Commands
There are a number of commands that server-side users can enter that the bot will respond to.
- /help15 - Prints a help message that displays the bot's purpose, as well as numerous commands that the bot is capable of
- /timetill15 - Prints the amount of time until the next DAY 15, down to the second! Currently operates under Mountain Standard/Mountain Daylight Time.
- /howareyou15 - Prints a message reflecting how the bot is currently doing.

More features are still bound to be added, as this is a fairly new project. See `changelog.md` for a record of changes made since the bot was added to GitHub.
